In this exercise, you will load a Manuel Eisner’s dataset to capture the developments in homicides from Middle Ages to 20th century.

Your task: Explore the data and create the visualisations as instructed in the script.

Submit to Github this script with solutions and its knitted version.
Submit to Brightspace a document with the (1) URL of this script and its knitted version in Github (2) answer of 250 words to the Final Question and (3) the Final Plot.
This exercise is based on the dataset provided by OurWorldInData project based at the Oxford University.

The long-term trend in Homicides in Western Europe
Understanding how homicide rates have changed prior to the modern era requires the help of historians and archivists. Manuel Eisner, a criminology professor at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues published the Historical Violence Database a compilation of data on long-term trends in homicide rates, in addition to qualitative information such as the cause of death, perpetrator and victim. This database is limited to countries with relatively complete historical records on violence and crime – mainly Western Europe and the US.

Starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, these European regions have consistent police records of those accused of murder or manslaughter and annual counts of homicide victims. To go back further in time, reaching as far back as the thirteenth century, Eisner collected estimates (from historical records of coroner reports, court trials, and the police) of homicide rates made in over ninety publications by scholars.

Homicide rates – measured as the number of homicides per 100,000 individuals – up to 1990 are sourced from Eisner’s (2003) publication and the Historical Violence Database.

Are homicide rates in Europe today lower or higher than in the past? Using the provided dataset, display and describe the long-run homicide rates for the five European regions: Italy, England, Germany, Netherlands and Scandinavia.

Load the available data from ourworldindata.org
You should always interrogate the source of your data. Who compiled it, from where, what is missing, how representative the data are? Check the data/Metadata.txt to learn about the data provenance.

Western_Europe <- read_csv("data/homicide-rates-across-western-europe.csv")
Inspect the data
How clean and analysis-ready is the dataset? Do you understand what the column names represent? What is the difference between rate and homicide number?

Ok, the data look good except for the column Homicide rate in Europe over long-term (per 100,000) which is not very easy to work with.

Use the names() function and assignment key to relabel this column to homicides_per_100k
names(Western_Europe) [4] <- "homicides_per_100k"
names(Western_Europe)
## [1] "Entity"             "Code"               "Year"              
## [4] "homicides_per_100k"
Now, that you have looked at what the data looks like and what it represents, and streamlined it, let’s see what big picture it contains.

Let’s see what the long-term trend is in homicides
use ggplot() function and remember the+ at the end of the line
chose a meaningful geom_......() for geometry (hint: points are not great)
load Year on the x axis and homicides_per_100k column in y axis
to color individual country entries consistently, assign the country column to the argument color.
provide meaningful title and axis labels
remember to change the eval flag so that the code chunk renders when knitted
Western_Europe %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year,y=homicides_per_100k))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour="blue", linewidth=1)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homicides per 100k")+
  ggtitle("Homicides")+  
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x=element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16,face="bold",hjust=0.5))
 Alright, the homicide rates should all be descending over time. What a comfort. But the viz is not super clear. Let’s check the rates for individual countries.

Uncouple the homicides of individual countries for easier view
You can visualize each country’s trend separately by adding an extra argument to the ggplot, the facet_wrap() and feeding it the country column. If in doubt, check your ggplot tutorial and your country column name for exact usage.

reuse the ggplot from the chunk above
insert facet_wrap() after the specification of geometry to split countries in separate charts
change the facet “layout” to two columns and three rows so that the trends are easier to see in horizontal layout.
Western_Europe %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year,y=homicides_per_100k))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour="blue", linewidth=1)+
  facet_wrap(~ Entity, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homicides per 100k")+
  ggtitle("Homicides")+  
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x=element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16,face="bold",hjust=0.5),
        legend.position = "bottom")


Compare the trends in homicide with the pattern of reign duration among Danish rulers through time.
Load your Danish king dataset. Hopefully it is tidy and your years and duration of reign are all numeric.
You need to have a consistent way of plotting the rulers’ reign on the x axis, so I recommend you create a midyear column by calculating the middle of each monarch’s rule (Hint: midyear = endyear - (endyear-startyear)/2)
Start a ggplot plotting midyear on x axis and duration on y axis
Try geom_smooth() for geometry
Provide meaningful labels and a title
How would you characterize the trend compared to the homicides above?
kings_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Midyear,y=Duration))+
  geom_smooth()+
  ggtitle("Duration Of Rule")+  
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x=element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16,face="bold",hjust=0.5))
Final Tasks
Plot: In the facetted plot above, move the legend from the current position on the side to below the facets, and label it “Country” instead of “Entity”.

Rmarkdown:

edit the author of the document, and convert ‘Final Tasks’ into heading #2 (like the other headings)
add a floating table of contents to your Rmarkdown document,
provide informative chunk-names and edit flags in your R chunks, and
automatically generate a timestamp to show when the document was last updated. (Hint: check the Rmarkdown episode in our Data Carpentry tutorial)
Final question:
In <250 words articulate your answer on the basis of the data visualisations to the following question:** are we more civilized today?** (Can you find an article or a book that discusses this topic?)

The data visualizations suggest that society has become more stable and less violent over time. The first graph shows a significant decline in homicides per 100,000 people, indicating that lethal violence has decreased dramatically from past centuries to the present.

The second graph, showing the duration of rule over time, indicates increasing political stability. Longer reigns suggest fewer violent upheavals, revolutions, or assassinations, implying that governance has become more structured and predictable.

While civilization can be measured in many ways—technology, rights, and social norms—these trends in reduced violence and increased stability suggest that societies have become more organized and less reliant on force to maintain order. However, challenges remain, and modern conflicts, inequalities, and systemic issues still shape the world today. (i have used chat gpt to analyse da data and articulated my answer from that)
